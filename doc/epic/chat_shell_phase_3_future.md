- [ ] Support multiple programming languages
- [ ] Add execution result streaming
- [ ] Implement security policies

---

## Epic 19: Subscription & Background Tasks
**Goal**: Support long-running subscription tasks

### User Stories
- [ ] Implement CreateSubscriptionTool
- [ ] Support background task scheduling
- [ ] Add periodic task execution
- [ ] Implement subscription status monitoring
- [ ] Support subscription cancellation
- [ ] Add notification mechanisms
- [ ] Implement task result persistence

## Epic 20: Data Table Processing
**Goal**: Query and analyze structured data

### User Stories
- [ ] Implement DataTableTool
- [ ] Support SQL-like queries on tables
- [ ] Add data transformation capabilities
- [ ] Support multiple data formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- [ ] Implement data visualization helpers
- [ ] Add aggregation and statistical functions
- [ ] Support large dataset handling

## Success Criteria for Phase 3

- Safe sandbox execution environment operational (if implemented)
- Background task system working reliably (if implemented)
- Advanced data processing capabilities functional (if implemented)
- All features well-documented with examples
- Security and performance maintained
- System remains maintainable and extensible

## Notes

These epics are considered optional and should be prioritized based on:
- Specific business requirements
- User feedback and demand
- Available resources and timeline
- Technical feasibility and dependencies

Each epic can be implemented independently as needed without blocking core functionality.
